# HTML 101

## Goal

You are going to practice tags which you have learned so far.

## Brief

Please create a few html-pages:

* index.html
* about.html
* contact.html

Make a folder named:

* media

Put a few _optimized_ images into that folder.

Make a folder _inside_ the media folder named: 

* icon

Put an image file with any logo you want inside that folder.

On the html-pages use (at least) the following tags:

* `doctype`
* `html`
* `head`
* `title`
* `meta` tags (at least viewport & description)
* `body` 
* `header` 
* `nav` 
* `ul` with `li`s 
* `main` 
* `section` 
* `h1` to `h6` (well, maybe not all through h6)
* `p` (paragraph)
* `img`
* `div` 
* `footer`

Some of the tags, like `header` and `footer`, should be repeated over all the pages.

Make sure the list items in the `ul` inside `nav` links to all the other pages.

Use images from the `media` folder as well as the logo in the `icon` folder, in addition use the following image on one of the pages with the absolute link to its current location: https://www.geek.no/noroff/HTML101/media/dilbert.1494.strip.gif

Deploy the page to a new Netlify-site.

Ensure that all HTML is semantic and have a purpose. This lesson is to be cloned and when completed pushed into your git repository.

Validate your pages using the validator: [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
